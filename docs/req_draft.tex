\title{Visualizing commit comments with chromograms}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Project description}
The projects main goal is it to visualize code repositories with
chromograms\footnote{\enquote{A chromogram is a visualization method that
converts textual data to colours, producing a data-dense display that can fit a
vast edit history onto a single image.}\cite{wattenberg2007}}.
We aim at supporting Git, Mercurial and Subversion with the main focus on git.
The chromograms' purpose is to visualize the content of the repositories and
not their structure as 
there already exists a wide range of tools supporting this usecase.\\
We hope that
this approach will result in additional insight, especially for large projects.
\section{Must-Haves:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [R01] The product's front end will be a website that will work with recent and well known browsers (Firefox 25.0, Internet Explorer 11, Google Chrome 31.0, Safari 7.0 and Opera 17.0).
\item [R02] The website will contain a home page, with an input field, a visualize button, a help button and a small example.
\item [R03] The input field is used to enter a URL to a repository.
\item [R04] The visualize button starts visualizing the provided repository and opens the rendering page.
\item [R05] The help button displays an overlaying help box.
\item [R07] The home page will also have a button to automatically insert an example URL into the input field.
\item [R08] The example is a static repogram, featuring some explanatory comments.
\item [R09] The system will support visualization of the commit comments of a provided git repository by representing every commit comment as a colored block.
\item [R10] A repository will be provided by the user by entering a URL which refers to the repository that should be visualized.
\item [R11] The rendering page will display a progress bar while the system is rendering the picture.
\item [R12] The rendering page will show the visualization after the rendering process is finished.
\item [R13] The visualization will be displayed in a single picture.
\item [R14] The visualization will provide an overall block view of all commit
	comments. Overall means that one image will be displayed for all
	commits, not segmented by commit time or modified files. Block view means
	that the image is a rectangle consisting of multiple rectangles
	representing each commit message.
\item [R15] The main visualization parameter will be the commit message.
\item [R16] The user will be able to select a period of time to visualize. 
\item [R17] The product will be released open source.
\item [R18] The application language will be English.
\item [R19] The application will detect if the repository's hosting server doesn't answer and will inform the user about that fact by printing an error message.
\item [R20] The application will detect if it has no access to the remote repository and will inform the user about that fact by printing an error message.
\item [R21] The system will support repositories whose commit comments are encoded in
	ANSI-ASCII. It will skip over Unicode glyphs.
\item [R22] The application will run on a Linux server having PHP 5.3 and Apache/2.2.24(Unix) installed.
\end{enumerate}
\section{May-Haves:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [M01] The product may support visualizing commit comments of mercurial and
	subversion repositories analogously to how git repositories are
	visualized.
\item [M02] There may be extra customization options on the image page where the user may be able to customize the visualization.
\item [M03] The user may be able to customize the color-mapping for the parameters in the customize dialog on the image page.
\item [M04] The user may be able to select which parameters he wants to influence the visualization on the customize page. In addition to the visualization parameters mentioned before the system may support parameters from the list below (see May-Have 5).
\item [M05] The application may support these parameters for the visualization:
\begin{enumerate}
\item user\\
(the person that made the commit to the repository)
\item time of day of commit\\
(the time of day at which the commit we're currently working with was made)
\item date of commit\\
(the date at which the commit we're currently working with was made)
\end{enumerate}
\item [M06] The parameters may influence a block's color and size.
\item [M07] The visualization may be supported by a legend mapping used colors to the corresponding words.
\item [M08] The product website may be responsive and may also work with mobile clients. In this context responsive means, the layout will be optimized for the current browser used by the user.
\item [M09] The visualization may be downloadable as a PDF, SVG or JPEG.
\item [M10] The user may click on a single block within the visualization to see further information about the specific commit comment represented by that block.
\item [M11] The application may be available in multiple languages.
\item [M12] The visualization of the repository created on the rendering page may be scalable.
\item [M13] The application may cache repositories that have already been displayed by the user.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Won't-have:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [N01] The product will not have a desktop client and cannot be used without a web browser.
\item [N02] The client will not support version control systems other than Mercurial, Subversion and Git.
\item [N03] The software will not have a native app for any mobile operating system.
\item [N04] The user will not be able to upload a folder of a git repository instead of an URL.
\item [N05] The application will not provide a user login interface where users can manage their pictures or their repositories.
\item [N06] The visualizations will not be be shared on Google+, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
\item [N07] The application will not provide access to the repositories.
\item [N08] The application will not provide access to protected repositories.
\item [N09] The application will not create animated renderings.
