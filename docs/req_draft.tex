\title{Visualizing commit comments with chromograms}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Must-Haves:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The product's front end is a website working with recent and well known browsers (e.g. Google Chrome, latest release of Firefox, Opera, Safari). 
\item The website contains a top bar with links to the main site, a documentation or help site and one to the site, where the repositories are visualized. 
\item The main site contains a short explanation what the sites purpose is and shows some example pictures. 
\item The rendering site display a progress bar while the back-end renders the pictures. After rendering is finished it shows the picture of the visualization.
\item It supports visualization of the commit comments as blocks with different colors of git repositories from a given URL. 
\item The visualization is displayed in an overall block view in one picture. A overall block view means no distinction for different days or files.
\item The main visualization parameter is the commit message.
\item The product is released open source 
\item The product is usable with the Apache/2.2.24(Unix).
\item For every rendered image exists a legend which maps the used colors to the corresponding words.
\item The applications language is English.
\item The application detects if the repository hosting server doesn't answer and exits with an error message.
\item The application detectes if it has no acces to the remote repository and exits with an error message.
\item The supported encoding of the repository comments is ANSI-ASCII.
\end{enumerate}
\section{May-Haves:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The product supports visualizing mercurial and subversion repositories as described above.
\item The end-user is able to select which parameters he wants to influence the visualization on the website. In addition to the ones mentioned before we allow parameters from the list below (see 14).
\item The end-user is able to customize the color-mapping for the parameters.
\item The product website is responsive by using Bootstrap and works also with mobile clients. In this context responsive means, the layout is optimized for the current browser being used by the end user.
\item The user may upload a folder of a git repository instead of an URL.
\item The visualization is downloadable as PDF or JPEG.
\item The visualizations can be posted on google+, facebook, twitter and instagr4m.
\item The application can run with a basic Linux environment with an up-to-date Apache, postgresql database and php5.3 (or higher) when installed and has a well documented installation manual.
\item The website can display chromograms for repositories, which are protected by a password. Therefore an additional field to enter the password is displayed on the rendering page.
\item A block of the rendered image can be clicked and then displays its information about commit coments.
\item The application is available in multiple languages.
\item The rendered image is scalable.
\item If the application has no acces tries to recover from this error by promting the user for ssh credentials. 
\item The application supports these parameters for influence the visualization:
\begin{enumerate}
\item user\\
(the person that made the commit to the repository)
\item kind of change\\  
(the numbers of lines that were added, modified or deleted with the commit we're working with)
\item only added something \\
(taking only the commits into account that added lines)
\item only deleted something\\
(taking only the commits into account that removed lines)
\item time of day of commit\\
(the time of day at which the commit we're currently working with was made)
\item date of commit\\
(the date at which the commit we're currently working with was made)
\item commit message\\
(the commit message of the user)
\end{enumerate}
\item The parameters may influence a block's color, size, alignment and order.
\item The application can cache repositories that are already displayed by any user.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Won't-have:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The product will not have a desktop client and can be used without a web browser.
\item The client will not support version control systems other than mercurial, subversion and git.
\item The software will not have a native app for any mobile operating system.
\item The application will not provide a user login interface where users can manage their pictures or their git repositories.
\item The application will not provide access to the git repositories.
\item The application will not provide a visualization of the structure of the repository.
\item The application will not provide access to ssh key protected repositories.
\item The application will not create movies of the rendering.
\item The application will not encode more than ANSI-ASCII for the repository comments.
\end{enumerate}
