\title{Visualizing commit comments with chromograms}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

Use-case: Visualizing a public Git repository \\
Primary actor: User of a desktop browser \\
Goal in context: Visualizing the repository in an overall block view with standard parameters \\
Preconditions: Browser with Internet connection and an URL to a Git repository\\
Trigger: The user wants to get a visualization of his Git repository \\

Scenario:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user opens the webpage and arrives at the start page.
\item The user clicks on \enquote{Render} and the browser loads the page where
	she can enter the URL to the Git repository. 
\item The user enters the URL for the Git repository. 
\item The user clicks on \enquote{Go}. (See exception 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
\item The server clones the repository.
\item The webpage shows a progress bar with an information text displayed beneath
	it. (See Exception 6, 7)
\item The webpage shows the repository's visualization.
\item The users takes a screenshot to save the picture. 
\end{enumerate}

Exceptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The URL is illegal $\rightarrow$ The website shows an error message:
	\enquote{You need to enter a legal link to a Git repository} and goes
	back to the \enquote{Render}--Page.
\item The URL doesn't point to a Git repository. $\rightarrow$  The website
	shows an error message: \enquote{You need to enter a legal link to a git
	repository} and goes back to the \enquote{Render}--Page.
\item The Repository is password protected $\rightarrow$ The website shows an
	error message: \enquote{The Git repository has to be without password
	protection} and goes back to the \enquote{Render}--Page.
\item The repository is protected with a private SSH key $\rightarrow$ The
	website shows an error message: \enquote{The Git repository has to be
	without SSH key protection.} and goes back to the
	\enquote{Render}--Page.
\item The repository is empty$\rightarrow$ The website displays an error
	message: \enquote{The repository is empty} and goes back to the
	\enquote{Render}--Page.
\item The server hosting the repository doesn't respond $\rightarrow$ The
	website shows an error message after timeout: \enquote{The Git
	repository is currently unavailable. Please try again later.} and goes
	back to the \enquote{Render}--Page. 
\item The repository is too big $\rightarrow$  The server attempts to obtain a
	smaller copy of the repository by doing a shallow clone, containing only
	the 50 most recent commits. If the repository is still too big, the
	follwoing error message is shown: \enquote{The repository is to bug. Please try another one.}
\end{enumerate}

Priority: high \\
Frequency of use: Very often --- this is the main functionality of the system\\
