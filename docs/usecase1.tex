\maketitle


Use-case: Visualizing a public git repository \\
Primary actor: User of a desktop browser \\
Goal in context: Visualizing the repository in an overall block view with standard parameters \\
Preconditions: Browser with internet connection and an URL for a git repository to insert \\
Trigger: User want to get a visualization of his git repository \\

Scenario:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User calls the webpage.
\item User clicks on \grqq Render\grqq ~and it loads the page where you can enter the URL for the git repository. 
\item User enters URL for the git repository. 
\item Users clicks on \grqq Go\grqq. (See Exception 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
\item Webpage shows progress bar with some information. (See Exception 6, 7)
\item Webpage shows visualized repository.
\item To save the picture the user takes a screenshot.
\end{enumerate}

Exceptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Illegal URL $\rightarrow$ The website shows an error message: \glqq You need to enter a legal link to a git repository\grqq and goes back to the \glqq Render\grqq-Page.
\item The URL doesn't contain a git repository. $\rightarrow$  The website shows an error message: \glqq You need to enter a legal link to a git repository\grqq and goes back to the \glqq Render\grqq-Page.
\item The Repository is password protected $\rightarrow$ May-have implements this, apart from that the website shows an error message: \glqq The git repository has to be without password protection\grqq and goes back to the \glqq Render\grqq-Page.
\item The Repository is protected with private ssh key $\rightarrow$ The website shows an error message: \glqq The git repository has to be without ssh key protection.\grqq and goes back to the \glqq Render\grqq-Page, we don't handle this.
\item Empty repository $\rightarrow$ The website shows an error message: \glqq The repository is empty\grqq and goes back to the \glqq Render\grqq-Page.
\item Repository doesn't respond $\rightarrow$ The website shows an error message after timeout: \glqq The git repository doesn't answer. Please try it later.\grqq and goes back to the \glqq Render\grqq-Page. 
\item Repository is too big $\rightarrow$  try to reduce repository and visualize this or error message if it is still too big: \glqq The repository is to bug. Please try another one.\grqq
\end{enumerate}

Priority: high \\
Frequency of use: Very often - this is main functionality of the system\\
