  <div class = "modal-body">
    <p><strong>RepoGrams will help you understand a project's history.</strong> It uses a simple visual metaphor to represent a project's history across multiple metrics of interest. It supports metrics like:

      <img src="/images/pattern-anatomy.png" width="500"></img>
      <li>Who made commits, how often, and how much code did their commits change</li>
      <li>The number of programming languages used in a project over time</li>
      <li>How often developers changed code across different modules (directories)</li><br>

RepoGrams can help:<br>

    <ol>
      <li type="disc"><strong>Managers</strong> to analyze a team's performance and pin-point workflow issues</li>
      <li type="disc"><strong>Developers</strong> to understand the workflow and the history of an unfamiliar project</li>
      <li type="disc"><strong>Researchers</strong> in the software engineering community to juxtapose multiple project repositories to select an appropriate set of evaluation targets</li>
    </ol>

        <p>To use RepoGrams, begin by entering a git URL of the repository that you want to study:</p>
        <img src="/images/addrepo.png" width="450"></img><br>
        <br><p>Next, click on the "Switch" button to see a list of available metrics.</p>
        <img src="/images/metricSwitch.png" width="450"></img><br>
        <br><p>Select one or more metrics of your choice from the list:</p> 
        <img src="/images/metricSelectPopup.png" width="500"></img><br>
        <br><p>Each metric you select will compute a value for each commit in the repository you selected. The displayed results are color coded per commit block and each color corresponds to a value in the legend for the metric.</p>

        </accordion-heading> 
        <p>There are two options to choose from when grouping your results:
        <li><strong>Group by metric</strong> will group your results by the metrics you selected. For example when you have multiple repositories loaded, it will display the results of each repository under each different metric.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Group by repository</strong> will group the results by repository instead.</li></p>

        <font size="3"><p>There are 3 options for scaling displayed block lengths:</p></font>
        <li><strong>Fixed block length: </strong>sets each commit block length to be the same for each repository.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Logarithmic block length: </strong>scales the length of each commit block logarithmically with respect to the number of lines changed in the commit.</li><br>

        <font size="3"><p>There are also 2 options for comparing results between repositories:</p></font>
        <li><strong>Globally Normalized: </strong>This option will initally set all commit block widths to be the same before the scaling so that results are comparable between repositories.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Project Normalized: </strong>This option will optimize the commit block widths for each individual repository so that each result fills the screen.</li><br>
